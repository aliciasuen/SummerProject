## Abstract 
Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates the association between adverse health outcomes and air pollution exposure. However, the underlying biological mechanisms
remain poorly understood. With the emerge of technologies such as arrays andmetabolomics, a wide range of new biomarkers can be measured and identified.This study aimed to (i) characterise the biological signatures of exposure to air pollution (NO2, PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance) using the serum biomarkers from the UK Biobank (n = 28) and the linked NMR-measured blood biomarkers (n = 168)
from Nightingale platform; (ii) investigate the subsequent associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 93,845 individuals from the UK Biobank. This study used
univariate linear regression with multiple testing correction to investigate the significant biomarkers associated with each air pollutants and CVD status. For the
multivariate analysis, stability selection-based LASSO and sparse PLS models were
used to account for complex correlations between the metabolites. Most biomarkers
were selected mutually across the air pollutants in both univariate and multivariate model, suggesting the air pollutants have similar biological responses. Direct
bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lipoprotein A and trigylerides in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were selected consistently to be associated
with multiple air pollutants and CVD. The results corroborated previous findings that
lipid metabolism is related to air pollution exposure and showed the potential biological pathways between air pollution and CVD. The study is also one of the largest
scale cross-sectional study of metabolic biomarkers and air pollution exposure. To
date, it is probably the first study to use stability selection-based approach for the
analyses.
